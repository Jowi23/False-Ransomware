# False-Ransomware
This is a false ransomware. if you open it you'll see a window and makes you enter a key. You will need to DM me on discord to get the key. Jowi23#7618
This is a file called antivirus that if you open it it will simply open a fake cmd with text and a key box. in the key box you'll need the key. to get the key Dm me on discord. Jowi23#7618
Once you did that send it to a friend via discord or more chatting apps.
When he opens it, he will see the cmd and he wont be able to do anything since i programmed it to the screen being absolutely black so the victim cant open any task admin to remove the virus and more. Go to code to see the key, anyway ill tell it to you here, its 2317. you can change it by editing the code and changing "%pass%="
Thanks for your time.
